# Aware Framework

A powerful AI agent workflow framework designed for building and orchestrating complex AI-driven automation tasks.

## Features

- üöÄ **Workflow-Based Architecture**: Build complex AI tasks using a modular workflow system
- üîÑ **Dynamic Execution**: Support for conditional branching and parallel execution
- üõ† **Extensible Tools**: Rich set of built-in tools with easy extension capabilities
- ü§ñ **LLM Integration**: Seamless integration with various LLM providers
- üîç **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- üìä **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and monitoring capabilities

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 18.0.0)
- npm (latest stable version)

### Installation

```bash
npm install @aware/framework
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { Workflow, WorkflowBuilder } from '@aware/framework';

// Create a simple workflow
const workflow = new WorkflowBuilder()
  .addNode('search', {
    type: 'action',
    action: {
      type: 'script',
      name: 'webSearch',
      params: {
        query: '${searchQuery}'
      }
    }
  })
  .build();

// Execute the workflow
const result = await workflow.execute({
  variables: {
    searchQuery: 'AI frameworks comparison'
  }
});
```

## Architecture

Aware is built on a modular architecture with several key components:

- **Workflow Engine**: Core execution engine for managing workflow states
- **Node System**: Extensible node types for different operations
- **Tool Registry**: Plugin system for adding new capabilities
- **Type System**: Comprehensive type definitions for safety
- **Context Management**: Workflow context and variable management
